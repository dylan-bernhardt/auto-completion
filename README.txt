Hello !

Please find source codes into /src. The dictonaries are available in /txt. 

Once in the folder, our app compiles by typing "make" in the terminal. It generates an executable and objects files in the folder /obj. 
To launch the app, you have to write down "./exe" in the terminal. 

Our app offers different functions :
    - predict a word from a string
    - add and delete a word from prediction dictionnary
    - auto-update the usage of words in the prediction dictionnary
    - allows the user to add words that are not in the french dictionary ( as acronyms ) 

All the commands to use our app are clearly explained while using it.

The command "make clean" allows you to delete all the .o files and the executable.
